title = The Heat's On 
overview = After an absence of three years, Mae West returned to the screen in the musical comedy The Heat's On. La West is cast as Fay Lawrence, a famous Broadway actress who is loved intensely by her producer Tony Ferris (William Gaxton). Rival producer Forrest Stanton (Alan Dinehart) steals Fay away from Ferris by convincing her that she's been blacklisted from Broadway by blue-nosed moralist Hannah Bainbridge (Almira Sessions). Meanwhile, Hannah's puckish brother Hubert (Victor Moore) syphons money from his sister's "clean up show business" committee to produce a musical show for his actress niece Janey (Mary Roche). Somehow, all these characters converge for a spectacular closing production number spotlighting the formidable Fay. Part of the reason for the failure of The Heat's On is the fact that Mae West didn't write her own dialogue, as was usually her custom. The film performed so poorly that it would be 27 years before West would again appear on the Big Screen.

In "20 Dates," directed by Myles Berkowitz and produced by Fox Searchlight Pictures, we follow the journey of Myles, a divorced man in L.A. who is on a mission to find true love while also pursuing a career in filmmaking. With the support of his agent Richard and a mysterious investor named Elie, Myles embarks on a unique project - going on 20 dates in front of a camera to capture real-life romance. As he navigates through the ups and downs of dating, Myles grapples with the conflicting desires of Elie for sensationalism and his own quest for genuine connection. Along the way, he seeks advice from his film teacher Robert McKee on the possibility of finding love in the modern world. 

Amidst the whirlwind of his dating experiment, Myles meets Elisabeth, who embodies everything he's been searching for in a partner. As the pressure mounts to complete the 20 dates and satisfy Elie's demands, Myles must confront the challenge of balancing his filmmaking aspirations with his budding relationship with Elisabeth. Will he be able to stay true to himself, finish the project, and win Elisabeth's heart, or will the lines between reality and fiction blur in this comedic yet authentic exploration of love and filmmaking? With a runtime of 1 hour and 27 minutes, "20 Dates" offers a glimpse into the unpredictable world of romance, all while keeping audiences guessing with its intriguing premise. A comedy so real you'll think it's fiction.

overview = A doctor has a lifelike, anatomically-correct medical dummy, with muscles and organs visible through its clear skin, named Pin (after Pinocchio). Via ventriloquism, Pin explains bodily functions in a way kids can relate to. When the over-strict doctor and his wife are killed in a car crash, his son (Leon) transfers his alter-ego into Pin, whom he always believed was alive. He starts using Pin as an excuse to over-protect his sister (Ursula) from admirers and deflect unwanted intrusions, even to the extent of committing murder.
