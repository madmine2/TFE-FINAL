The tension rises as she encounters unexpected problems along the way. Meanwhile, in the second story, an arcade whiz kid's innocent obsession with a game takes a deadly turn, leading to unforeseen consequences.

As the movie unfolds, the audience is introduced to a small-town priest who grapples with a crisis of faith and decides to leave town. However, his journey through the desert takes a sinister turn when he becomes the target of a mysterious black pick-up truck that stalks his every move.

Lastly, a seemingly ordinary family is faced with a monstrous problem when they discover that their issue with a rat is much larger and more sinister than they could have ever imagined. 

With an average rating of 5.4, "Nightmares" proves to be this year's sleeper hit, captivating audiences with its spine-tingling stories of horror and suspense.

title = Faraway, So Close! 
overview = The film opens with the angel Cassiel (Otto Sander) standing on the statue of the Angel of Victory overlooking post-Cold War Berlin. Growing ever more despondent over his fate as a mere observer of human life, rather than a vital part of it, Cassiel dreams of "crossing over" to the human world.And he does, as Karl Engel, a man who perhaps knows too much, perhaps like in many of Hitchcock's films, some harmless citizen who gets involved in an affair to which he is not up to. In fact, there is no one as kind and harmless as this newborn citizen of the Earth.We will follow Cassiels's adventures into a "thriller." This story which gets mangled with his own life is about weapons, more precisely about a weapon deal where the weapons - or INSTRUMENTS of violence -- are traded for IMAGES of violence.(Text from Wim Wenders site)

title = Machuca 
overview = Santiago, capital of Chile during the Marxist government of elected, highly controversial president Salvador Allende. Father McEnroe supports his leftist views by introducing a program at the prestigious "collegio" (Catholic prep school) St. Patrick to allow free admission of some proletarian kids. One of them is Pedro Machuca, slum-raised son of the cleaning lady in Gonzalo Infante's liberal-bourgeois home. Yet the new classmates become buddies, paradoxically protesting together as Gonzalo gets adopted by Pedro's slum family and gang. But the adults spoil that too, not in the least when general Pinochet's coup ousts Allende, and supporters such as McEnroe.
