fact : tagline = Inside Us Lives A Killer 

In the chilling and suspenseful movie "Killers," produced by Yoshinori Chiba, viewers are taken on a dark journey into the minds of two very different killers. Set in Tokyo and Jakarta, the film follows Mr. Nomura, an eerily handsome, sharply dressed, sociopathic serial killer who preys on the women of Tokyo, and Bayu, a world-weary journalist turned vigilante in Jakarta after brutally killing two sadistic robbers. As both killers document their violent acts online, they unwittingly form a twisted connection that leads to a deadly game of cat and mouse. With a budget of 228.5 million dollars, this Japanese-language film delves deep into the psyche of its characters, exploring themes of violence, morality, and the thin line between good and evil. As the tagline ominously states, "Inside Us Lives A Killer," reminding audiences that darkness can lurk within us all. Killing, advises Nomura, is something everyone ought to consider.

title = The Secret Life of Plants 
overview = The story is a documentary of research that shows fairly conclusively that plants are actually aware of what goes on around them, even miles away. It is somewhat humorous in the methods it uses to prove the secret life of plants, but thought-provoking in the conclusions it arrives at. The most wonderful thing about the film is the soundtrack. This is original music composed by Stevie Wonder. There is even a scene in the film of Stevie singing one of his songs in a boat on a river. This scene is very moving, as Stevie is blind and yet able to know where he is going. The scene is the climax to the movie, and metaphoric as to what has been presented about plants, that although they don't seem to have senses as human beings and animals do, they are quite well aware of what is going on around them and where they fit into this in the evolutionary process. 
duration of the movie = 1h35 
revenue = 52.7 millions of dollars 
Producer = Michael Braun

title = Johnny Mnemonic 
overview = A data courier, literally carrying a data package inside his head, must deliver it before he dies from the burden or is killed by the Yakuza.  In a dystopian 2021, Johnny (Keanu Reeves) is a data trafficker who has an implant that allows him to securely store data too sensitive for regular computer networks. On one delivery run, he accepts a package that not only exceeds the implant's safety limits - and will kill him if the data is not removed in time - but also contains information far more important and valuable than he had ever imagined. On a race against time, he must avoid the assassins sent to kill him and remove the data before it, too, ends his life.

As president Gorbachev was detained by the coup leaders, state-run TV and radio channels, usurped by the putschists, broadcast Tchaikovsky's "Swan Lake" instead of news bulletins, and crowds of protestors gathered around Moscow's White House, preparing to defend the stronghold of democratic opposition led by Boris Yeltsin, in the city of Leningrad thousands of confused, scared, excited and desperate people poured into the streets to become a part of the event, which was supposed to change their destiny.

title = The Event 
overview = In August 1991 a failed coup d'état attempt (known as Putsch) led by a group of hard-core communists in Moscow, ended the 70-year-long rule of the Soviets. The USSR collapsed soon after, and the tricolour of the sovereign Russian Federation flew over Kremlin. As president Gorbachev was detained by the coup leaders, state-run TV and radio channels, usurped by the putschists, broadcast Tchaikovsky's "Swan Lake" instead of news bulletins, and crowds of protestors gathered around Moscow's White House, preparing to defend the stronghold of democratic opposition led by Boris Yeltsin. In the city of Leningrad, thousands of confused, scared, excited, and desperate people poured into the streets to become a part of the event, which was supposed to change their destiny. A quarter of a century later, Sergei Loznitsa revisits the dramatic moments of August 1991 and casts an eye on the event which was hailed worldwide as the birth of "Russian democracy".

In "Secrets of the Tribe," directed by José Padilha, the audience is taken on a gripping journey into the Amazon where western anthropologists encounter the Yanomami tribe, one of the last unacculturated tribes on Earth. As the most exhaustively filmed and studied tribe, the Yanomami's way of life is put under the microscope by a group of scientists led by producer Mike Chamberlain. Despite their initial "do no harm" creed, the anthropologists inadvertently disrupt the tribe's existence, leading to chaos within both the Yanomami community and the anthropology world. With a tagline promising a behind-the-scenes look at a scientific community torn apart by infighting, this thought-provoking film delves into the consequences of invasive study and the clash of cultures. Released on the 22nd of January 2010 in Brazil, "Secrets of the Tribe" runs for 1 hour and 38 minutes, earning a revenue of 53.0 million dollars against a budget of 269.2 million dollars.
