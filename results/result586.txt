title = Sun Valley Serenade 
overview = Skating star Sonja Henie and the Glenn Miller Orchestra share the spotlight in Sun Valley Serenade. Henie plays a Norwegian refugee adopted by band pianist John Payne, who mistakenly thought that the full-grown Miss Henie was a 10-year-old little girl. Payne's girlfriend, Lynn Bari, is a soloist with the Miller band, and also a violently jealous sort. When Bari quits Miller out of pique, Henie stages an elaborate ice show as a substitute. This impromptu spectacular thrills the audience at the Sun Valley resort hotel where most of the action takes place. Joan Davis and Milton Berle provide comic relief to the music and romance (you haven't lived until you've seen Berle on skis), while The Nicholas Brothers and Dorothy Dandridge perform a lively chorus of "Chattanooga Choo Choo."

fact : Producer = Devin McGinn 

In the mysterious and eerie setting of "Skinwalker Ranch," a team of experts from Modern Defense Enterprises embarks on a perilous journey to uncover the truth behind a series of unexplained phenomena that have plagued the area since 2010. From UFO sightings to livestock mutilation, the ranch has become a hotbed of strange occurrences, culminating in the chilling disappearance of ranch owner Hoyt Miller's young son, Cody, on November 11, 2010. Close to a year later, Modern Defense Enterprises has sent a team of experts to document and investigate the mysterious occurrences, which only escalate upon their arrival. As the team delves deeper into the mysteries surrounding the ranch, tensions run high and the stakes become increasingly dire. With each passing day, the line between curiosity and danger blurs, forcing the team to confront the ultimate question: are they willing to risk everything, including their own lives, in order to unlock the dark secrets of Skinwalker Ranch? The group debates whether the answers are worth risking their lives for, or if they should just call off the investigation and leave the ranch—that is, if leaving is actually an option.

title = Eight Men Out 
overview = The great Chicago White Sox team of 1919 is the saddest team to ever win a pennent. The team is bitter at their penny pincher owner, Charles Comiskey, and at their own teammates. Gamblers take advantage of this opportunity to offer some players $ to throw the series (Most of the players didn't get as much as promised.) But Buck Weaver and the great Shoeless Joe Jackson turn back at the last minute to try and play their best. The Sox actually almost come back from a 3-1 deficit. 2 years later, the truth breaks out and the Sox are sued on multiple accounts. They are found innocent by the jury but baseball commissioner Landis has other plans. The eight players are suspended for life, and Buck Weaver, for the rest of his life, tries to clear his name.

title = King Rat 
overview = When Singapore surrendered to the Japanese in 1942 the Allied POWs, mostly British but including a few Americans, were incarcerated in Changi prison. This was a POW detention center like no other. There were no walls or barbed-wire fences for the simple reason that there was no place for the prisoners to escape to. Included among the prisoners is the American Cpl. King, a wheeler dealer who has managed to established a pretty good life for himself in the camp. While most of the prisoners are near starvation and have uniforms that are in tatters, King eats well and and has crisp clean clothes to wear every day. His nemesis is Lt. Robin Grey, the camp Provost who attempts to keep good order and discipline. He knows that King is breaking camp rules by bartering with the Japanese but can't quite get the evidence he needs to stop him. King soon forms a friendship with Lt. Peter Marlowe an upper class British officer who is fascinated with King's élan and no rules approach to life...

title = On Our Merry Way 
overview = Oliver Pease gets a dose of courage from his wife Martha and tricks the editor of the paper (where he writes lost pet notices) into assigning him the day's roving question. Martha suggests, "Has a little child ever changed your life?" Oliver gets answers from two slow-talking musicians, an actress whose roles usually feature a sarong, and an itinerant cardsharp. In each case the "little child" is hardly innocent: in the first, a local auto mechanic's "baby" turns out to be fully developed as a woman and a musician; in the second, a spoiled child star learns kindness; in the third, the family of a lost brat doesn't want him returned. And Oliver, what becomes of him?

In the heartwarming film "On Our Merry Way," directed by Burgess Meredith and produced by United Artists, we follow the journey of Oliver Pease as he embarks on a quest to find stories about how little children have changed people's lives. With a budget of 150.4 million dollars, Oliver, a timid writer of lost pet notices, is encouraged by his wife Martha to seek out these tales of inspiration. Oliver tricks the editor of the paper into assigning him the day's roving question, "Has a little child ever changed your life?" Along the way, he encounters a variety of characters, including slow-talking musicians, a glamorous actress, and a cunning cardsharp. Each story Oliver uncovers reveals that the "little child" in question is far from innocent, leading to unexpected twists and turns. In the first story, a local auto mechanic's "baby" turns out to be fully developed as a woman and a musician. In the second story, a spoiled child star learns kindness. In the third story, the family of a lost brat doesn't want him returned. As Oliver delves deeper into these narratives, he also undergoes a transformation of his own. Will he find the courage to face his own challenges and discover the true meaning of life-changing moments?
