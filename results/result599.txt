title = I Died a Thousand Times 
overview = I Died a Thousand Times is essentially a remake of the 1941 crime-drama classic High Sierra.  Jack Palance steps into the old Humphrey Bogart role as Roy "Mad Dog" Earle, the ageing bank robber who intends to pull off one last heist before retiring.  Sprung from prison by likeable crime boss Big Mac (Lon Chaney Jr.), Earle is commissioned to mastermind the robbery of a resort hotel.  His partners in crime include the hotheaded, immature Babe (Lee Marvin) and Red (Earl Holliman), as well as "inside man" Mendoza (Perry Lopez).  Also along for the ride is Marie (Shelley Winters), a dance-hall girl whom Babe has picked up. Marie falls in love with Earle, but he has eyes only for Velma (Lori Nelson), the club-footed daughter of a farmer (Ralph Moody) whom Earle had earlier befriended.  While the 1955 film cannot match the excellence of its 1941 role model, I Died a Thousand Times works quite well on its own terms.

title = Everything Is Copy 
overview = Jacob Bernstein's extremely entertaining film is a tribute to his mother Nora Ephron: Hollywood-raised daughter of screenwriters who grew up to be an ace reporter turned piercingly funny essayist turned novelist/screenwriter/playwright/director. Ephron comes vibrantly alive onscreen via her words; the memories of her sisters, colleagues, former spouses, and many friends; scenes from her movies; and, above all, her own inimitable presence. Watch any given moment of Ephron being her sparkling but caustically witty self (for instance, this response to a scolding talk show host—"You have a soft spot for Julie Nixon, don't you. See, I don't...") and you find it hard to believe that she’s been gone from our midst for three years. Everything Is Copy (Ephron's motto, inherited from her mother) is a lovingly drawn but frank portrait and, incidentally, a vivid snapshot of an earlier, livelier, bitchier, and funnier moment in New York culture.

He is her polar opposite: he chases women, smokes cigars, and has just published his first novel. During their pursuit of the story, Peter and Sabrina clash over virtually everything - he also subjects Sabrina to indecent exposure in front of a group of boy scouts after he catches her skinny dipping.

In the war-torn setting of Vietnam, "The Boys in Company C," directed by Sidney J. Furie and produced by Andre Morgan, follows a group of disillusioned young soldiers. Disheartened by the futility of combat and appalled by the corruption around them, they face constant danger due to the incompetence of their company commander. However, a glimmer of hope emerges when they are presented with a unique opportunity - to secure a safer position by intentionally losing a soccer game against a South Vietnamese team. This risky decision could allow them to spend the remainder of their tour playing exhibition matches away from the front lines.

title = Killers 
overview = Mr. Nomura is an eerily handsome, sharply dressed, sociopathic serial killer who preys on the women of Tokyo. In Jakarta, a world-weary journalist named Bayu finds himself unexpectedly falling into vigilantism after brutally killing two sadistic robbers. When each posts videos of their violent sprees online, the pair find one another on the Internet and begin a toxic and competitive duel. While Bayu clings to the hope that he can resume a normal life, Nomura continues to spill blood without remorse. Killing, advises Nomura, is something everyone ought to consider. 
production compagnie = Nikkatsu 

In the intense thriller "Killers," we are introduced to two very different men on opposite sides of the law. Mr. Nomura, a charming yet chilling serial killer in Tokyo, and Bayu, a journalist turned vigilante in Jakarta, both find themselves entangled in a dangerous game of cat and mouse. As they each document their violent acts online, their paths eventually cross in a toxic and competitive showdown. While Bayu grapples with the consequences of his actions and hopes for redemption, Nomura continues his killing spree without a hint of remorse. As the tension escalates, the question of morality and the nature of violence take center stage in this gripping Nikkatsu production.
