title = Sun Valley Serenade 
overview = Skating star Sonja Henie and the Glenn Miller Orchestra share the spotlight in Sun Valley Serenade. Henie plays a Norwegian refugee adopted by band pianist John Payne, who mistakenly thought that the full-grown Miss Henie was a 10-year-old little girl. Payne's girlfriend, Lynn Bari, is a soloist with the Miller band, and also a violently jealous sort. When Bari quits Miller out of pique, Henie stages an elaborate ice show as a substitute. This impromptu spectacular thrills the audience at the Sun Valley resort hotel where most of the action takes place. Joan Davis and Milton Berle provide comic relief to the music and romance (you haven't lived until you've seen Berle on skis), while The Nicholas Brothers and Dorothy Dandridge perform a lively chorus of "Chattanooga Choo Choo."

fact : date of release = the 6 of March 2012 

In "Into the White," directed by Petter Næss and released on the 6th of March 2012, viewers are taken on a gripping journey high above the harsh Norwegian wilderness during World War II. The film, inspired by a true story, follows English and German pilots who find themselves forced to work together to survive after shooting each other down. As they navigate the brutal winter and the absurdity of war, unlikely friendships blossom among the cast including Stig Henrik Hoff, Lachlan Nieboer, Rupert Grint, and Florian Lukas. Despite being an anti-war movie, the camaraderie that develops between the characters challenges the enmity that brought them together in the first place. With a runtime of 1 hour and 40 minutes, "Into the White" is a poignant reminder of the human connections that can transcend even the most dire circumstances. This English-language film from Norway, produced by Trollhättan Film AB and Peter Aalbæk Jensen, received an average rating of 6.9 and had a budget of 113.5 million dollars, though it did not generate any revenue at the box office.

In the gripping thriller "InSight", directed by Richard Gabai and produced by John Constantine, we follow the story of Kaitlyn, an ER nurse who gains the ability to experience the memories of a stabbing victim after being accidentally electrocuted. Despite her best efforts to seek help from those around her, including the police, Kaitlyn is met with skepticism. Determined to solve the crime and save her own sanity, she teams up with a detective, portrayed by Max Perlich, and delves into the victim's past. As she unravels the brutal truth, Kaitlyn also learns unexpected lessons about life, love, sorrow, and forgiveness.

title = Eight Men Out 
overview = The great Chicago White Sox team of 1919 is the saddest team to ever win a pennent. The team is bitter at their penny pincher owner, Charles Comiskey, and at their own teammates. Gamblers take advantage of this opportunity to offer some players $ to throw the series (Most of the players didn't get as much as promised.) But Buck Weaver and the great Shoeless Joe Jackson turn back at the last minute to try and play their best. The Sox actually almost come back from a 3-1 deficit. 2 years later, the truth breaks out and the Sox are sued on multiple accounts. They are found innocent by the jury but baseball commissioner Landis has other plans. The eight players are suspended for life, and Buck Weaver, for the rest of his life, tries to clear his name.

In "Zombie Holocaust," a group of explorers embarks on a perilous journey to uncover the mysteries surrounding the cannibal god Kito. Landing on a remote island in the East Indies, they quickly find themselves ensnared in a deadly game of survival as they are pursued by both cannibals and zombies. The sinister Doctor O'Brien, who is experimenting with corpses and living humans, lurks in the shadows, conducting gruesome experiments. Amidst the chaos, Susan, a bold and alluring member of the expedition, rises to the occasion. As she gains acceptance with the natives as queen of the cannibals, she leads them in a fierce battle against the mad scientist and his army of the undead. Will Susan's cunning and bravery be enough to overcome the horrors that await on the island, or will they all fall victim to the madness unleashed by Doctor O'Brien?

Martha suggests, "Has a little child ever changed your life?" Oliver gets answers from two slow-talking musicians, an actress whose roles usually feature a sarong, and an itinerant cardsharp. In each case the "little child" is hardly innocent: in the first, a local auto mechanic's "baby" turns out to be fully developed as a woman and a musician; in the second, a spoiled child star learns kindness; in the third, the family of a lost brat doesn't want him returned.

In the heartwarming film "On Our Merry Way," directed by Burgess Meredith and produced by United Artists, we follow the journey of Oliver Pease as he embarks on a quest to find stories about how little children have changed people's lives. With a budget of 150.4 million dollars, Oliver, a timid writer of lost pet notices, is encouraged by his wife Martha to seek out these tales of inspiration. Oliver tricks the editor of the paper into assigning him the day's roving question, "Has a little child ever changed your life?" Along the way, he encounters a variety of characters, including slow-talking musicians, a glamorous actress, and a cunning cardsharp. Each story Oliver uncovers reveals that the "little child" in question is far from innocent, leading to unexpected twists and turns. In the first story, a local auto mechanic's "baby" turns out to be fully developed as a woman and a musician. In the second story, a spoiled child star learns kindness. In the third story, the family of a lost brat doesn't want him returned. As Oliver delves deeper into these narratives, he also undergoes a transformation of his own. Will he find the courage to face his own challenges and discover the true meaning of life-changing moments?
